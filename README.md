# Rocket-Elevator-Foundation
Week 10 of Odyssey - Quality & Test-Driven Development

[ELEVATOR MEDIA]

I am using https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity to suggest riders a new activity they can do.

I am testing in my spec file that I am getting an activity as well as its type in a string format

I am also testing a function to return the responses as HTML for us to use elsewhere.

[UNIT TESTS]

Throughout my project, I have implemented tests for my interventions controller and routing, as well as validity tests for my employee and user models
