# IBM&reg; will begin sunsetting IBM Watson&trade; Personality Insights on 1 December
# 2020. For a period of one year from this date, you will still be able to use Watson
# Personality Insights. However, as of 1 December 2021, the offering will no longer be
# available.<br/><br/>As an alternative, we encourage you to consider migrating to IBM
# Watson&trade; Natural Language Understanding, a service on IBM Cloud&reg; that uses deep
# learning to extract data and insights from text such as keywords, categories, sentiment,
# emotion, and syntax to provide insights for your business or industry. For more
# information, see [About Natural Language
# Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-about).
# {: deprecated}
#
# The IBM Watson Personality Insights service enables applications to derive insights from
# social media, enterprise data, or other digital communications. The service uses
# linguistic analytics to infer individuals' intrinsic personality characteristics,
# including Big Five, Needs, and Values, from digital communications such as email, text
# messages, tweets, and forum posts.
#
# The service can automatically infer, from potentially noisy social media, portraits of
# individuals that reflect their personality characteristics. The service can infer
# consumption preferences based on the results of its analysis and, for JSON content that
# is timestamped, can report temporal behavior.
# * For information about the meaning of the models that the service uses to describe
# personality characteristics, see [Personality
# models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/personality-insights?topic=personality-insights-models#models).
# * For information about the meaning of the consumption preferences, see [Consumption
# preferences](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/personality-insights?topic=personality-insights-preferences#preferences).
#
#
# **Note:** Request logging is disabled for the Personality Insights service. Regardless
# of whether you set the `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` request header, the service does not
# log or retain data from requests and responses.

    # @!method profile(content:, accept:, content_type: nil, content_language: nil, accept_language: nil, raw_scores: nil, csv_headers: nil, consumption_preferences: nil)
    # Get profile.
    # Generates a personality profile for the author of the input text. The service
    #   accepts a maximum of 20 MB of input content, but it requires much less text to
    #   produce an accurate profile. The service can analyze text in Arabic, English,
    #   Japanese, Korean, or Spanish. It can return its results in a variety of languages.
    #

    #   * [Requesting a
    #   profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/personality-insights?topic=personality-insights-input#input)
    #   * [Providing sufficient
    #   input](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/personality-insights?topic=personality-insights-input#sufficient)
    #
    #
    #   ### Content types
    #
    #    You can provide input content as plain text (`text/plain`), HTML (`text/html`),
    #   or JSON (`application/json`) by specifying the **Content-Type** parameter. The
    #   default is `text/plain`.
    #   * Per the JSON specification, the default character encoding for JSON content is
    #   effectively always UTF-8.
    #   * Per the HTTP specification, the default encoding for plain text and HTML is
    #   ISO-8859-1 (effectively, the ASCII character set).
    #
    #   When specifying a content type of plain text or HTML, include the `charset`
    #   parameter to indicate the character encoding of the input text; for example,
    #   `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8`.
    #
    #   **See also:** [Specifying request and response
    #   formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/personality-insights?topic=personality-insights-input#formats)
    #
    #
    #   ### Accept types
    #
    #    You must request a response as JSON (`application/json`) or comma-separated
    #   values (`text/csv`) by specifying the **Accept** parameter. CSV output includes a
    #   fixed number of columns. Set the **csv_headers** parameter to `true` to request
    #   optional column headers for CSV output.
    #
    #   **See also:**
    #   * [Understanding a JSON
    #   profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/personality-insights?topic=personality-insights-output#output)
    #   * [Understanding a CSV
    #   profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/personality-insights?topic=personality-insights-outputCSV#outputCSV).
    # @param content [Content] A maximum of 20 MB of content to analyze, though the service requires much less
    #   text; for more information, see [Providing sufficient
    #   input](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/personality-insights?topic=personality-insights-input#sufficient).
    #   For JSON input, provide an object of type `Content`.
    # @param accept [String] The type of the response. For more information, see **Accept types** in the method
    #   description.
    # @param content_type [String] The type of the input. For more information, see **Content types** in the method
    #   description.
    # @param content_language [String] The language of the input text for the request: Arabic, English, Japanese, Korean,
    #   or Spanish. Regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example,
    #   `en-US` is interpreted as `en`.
    #
    #   The effect of the **Content-Language** parameter depends on the **Content-Type**
    #   parameter. When **Content-Type** is `text/plain` or `text/html`,
    #   **Content-Language** is the only way to specify the language. When
    #   **Content-Type** is `application/json`, **Content-Language** overrides a language
    #   specified with the `language` parameter of a `ContentItem` object, and content
    #   items that specify a different language are ignored; omit this parameter to base
    #   the language on the specification of the content items. You can specify any
    #   combination of languages for **Content-Language** and **Accept-Language**.
    # @param accept_language [String] The desired language of the response. For two-character arguments, regional
    #   variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted
    #   as `en`. You can specify any combination of languages for the input and response
    #   content.
    # @param raw_scores [Boolean] Indicates whether a raw score in addition to a normalized percentile is returned
    #   for each characteristic; raw scores are not compared with a sample population. By
    #   default, only normalized percentiles are returned.
    # @param csv_headers [Boolean] Indicates whether column labels are returned with a CSV response. By default, no
    #   column labels are returned. Applies only when the response type is CSV
    #   (`text/csv`).
    # @param consumption_preferences [Boolean] Indicates whether consumption preferences are returned with the results. By
    #   default, no consumption preferences are returned.
    # @return [IBMCloudSdkCore::DetailedResponse] A `IBMCloudSdkCore::DetailedResponse` object representing the response.
